<h3>Method:</h3>
<hr>

* Used Fetch API to work with the IMDB API at [rapidapi.com](rapidapi.com) to grab titles.
* Instead of only retrieving a single genre,created an array with multiple genres. 
* Used Math.floor with Math.random which generated a different number during each page refresh.
* Used that number to grab a genre element out of the array.
* Added a template literal with the chosen element inside of the Fetch Url.
* Added parallax scrolling.
* Added anime.js.
